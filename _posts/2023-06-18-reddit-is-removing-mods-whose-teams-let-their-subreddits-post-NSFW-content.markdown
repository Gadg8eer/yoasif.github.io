Things are moving fast again, so this is going to be another quick and dirty post... Reddit is now removing mod teams without any pretense of speaking for moderators.

* * * 

In the newest front in the Reddit protest, subreddits had begun allowing NSFW content, in order to deprive Reddit of ad targeting opportunities for the subreddit.

Just a few minutes ago, the moderation teams for r/mildlyinteresting, r/interestingasfuck, and r/TIHI were mass removed.

u/Davis_Schina confirmed that they received this note from Reddit:

      <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/reddit/TIHI.png" alt="Screenshot of message sent to TIHI mods"/>

Moderators who want to retain control of their subreddits may want to restrict NSFW submissions again.
